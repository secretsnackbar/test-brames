> [!warning]
> Private notes should have a icon in front of them to show they will not propogate to [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)

You should see the shh emoji (ðŸ¤«) to the left of this private note -> [[Secret Note]][^1]
You should **not** see the shh emoji (ðŸ¤«) next to this public note -> [[README]]

Daily Notes should also be kept private imo, but this is optional -- you should see a  calendar emoji (ðŸ“†) before a daily note -> [[2022-12-11]]
