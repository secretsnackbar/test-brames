>[!info]  
> The following code block allows you to "freeze" the Dataview query result above into HTML.  
> If you use Obsidian Publish, this will allow you to publish the resource list as it is above.  
> I recommend running this, **after** you finish a project and are ready to commit it to _PARA/Archive.  
> To use: open command pallette, remove the spaces between < % and *, run "Templater: Replace all templates in Active File", and remove the triple backticks.
